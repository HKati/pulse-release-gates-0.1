  "title": "PULSE: Deterministic Release Gates for Safe & Useful AI",
  "description": "This preprint describes PULSE, a deterministic, fail‑closed system of release gates for ensuring AI systems are safe and useful. It introduces safety invariants across multiple dimensions (I₀–I₇), utility metrics (Q₁–Q₄) and service level objectives (SLO). The paper motivates the need for release gates and provides theoretical foundations as well as case studies.",
