# PULSE Badge Usage Policy

## Allowed
- Show **PULSE PASS/FAIL** badges generated by the official pack.
- Link PASS/FAIL badges to the corresponding Quality Ledger or `status.json`.
- Display the badge on PRs, READMEs, dashboards.

## Not allowed
- Recoloring PASS/FAIL semantics (PASS may not be red; FAIL may not be green).
- Using PULSE badges to represent non-PULSE tooling.
- Removing required context (e.g., pretending PASS without running the pack).

## Attribution
- “Powered by PULSE” (optional) with a link to the project is encouraged.
- For white-label scenarios, use the **generic gate** badge set (no PULSE mark).

## Compliance
If you violate this policy, we may request removal of the badge display.
