  "title": "PULSE: Deterministic Release Gates for Safe & Useful AI",
  "description": "PULSE provides deterministic, fail‑closed release gates across Safety (I₀–I₇), Utility (Q₁–Q₄) and SLO dimensions. It produces audit artefacts including a human‑readable Quality Ledger and SVG badges that summarise pass/fail states. This software package allows developers to enforce safety invariants, utility budgets and service level objectives prior to shipment.",
