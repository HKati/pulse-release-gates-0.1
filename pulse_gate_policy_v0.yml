# pulse_gate_policy_v0.yml
# Canonical required/advisory gate set for CI enforcement.
#
# Normative (required) gates are FAIL-closed:
#   - missing required gate => FAIL
#   - required gate == false => FAIL
#
# Diagnostic (advisory) gates never block shipping:
#   - missing advisory gate => WARN
#   - advisory gate == false => WARN
#
# This file intentionally defines ONLY:
#   - the gate set (required vs advisory)
#   - enforcement semantics around missing/unknown signals
#
# Thresholds / measurement details remain elsewhere (safe-pack / profiles).
