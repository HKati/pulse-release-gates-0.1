# PULSE Visual Map v0 – iconography for the Decision Field

This document defines a small, shared **visual vocabulary** for Pulse
and the Decision Field v0 layer.

The goal is not to standardise UI design, but to provide **lightweight
icons and glyphs** that can be reused across:

- docs,
- slides,
- lab notes,
- and demo artefacts.

All icons here are **non-normative**: they are meant as a visual
language, not as strict design requirements.

## 1. Paradox Core Seal

**Icon**

- `[(0 1)_P]`

**Meaning**

> *Paradox origin: two surface values unified into one higher‑order field
> state (P).*

- `0` and `1` represent a classical Boolean pair.
- `_P` marks that we are not in plain bit space any more, but in a
  **paradox-aware field**.
- The brackets `[...]` indicate a *sealed* unit: the paradox bit-pair is
  treated as a single state in the Decision Field.

**Typical use**

- Signature mark in docs (e.g. next to “Paradox Field” sections).
- Optional “core symbol” in diagrams that show paradox origin.
- GitHub / lab profile tagline element, e.g. in bios or headers.

## 2. EPF Mini Icon

**Icon**

- `⦿〰〰〰`

**Meaning**

> *EPF – Evaluation / Paradox Frontier and Energy / Potential Field.*

The icon encodes:

- `⦿` – a source / core,
- `〰〰〰` – waves or a field radiating outward.

EPF is intentionally **multi-readable**:

- as *Evaluation / Paradox Frontier* (the boundary where evaluation and
  paradox meet),
- and as *Energy / Potential Field* (a stability / tension field).

**Typical use**

- Inline marker for EPF-related text.
- Small icon next to sections that discuss field tension or shadow
  fields.

## 3. Paradox Field Icon

**Icon**

- `⇄`

**Meaning**

> *A and ¬A defining each other inside one field.*

The double arrow expresses:

- mutual dependence,
- bidirectional constraint,
- no simple “one way” implication.

It is not “A vs ¬A” as a conflict, but **A ⇄ ¬A** as a structured,
co‑defining pair in the Decision Field.

**Typical use**

- Before headings and callouts that describe paradox fields.
- In diagrams to mark regions with active paradox structure.

## 4. RDSI Stability Gauge

**Icons**

Three equivalent micro-gauges:

- `◔—◑—◕`
- `[ ■ ▣ □ ]`
- `▁▃▆█`

**Meaning**

> *RDSI – Release Decision Stability Index; stability and instability
> indicators.*

These are all stylised ways of showing **low → medium → high** stability:

- Left side (`◔`, `□`, `▁`) – lower stability / more volatility.
- Middle (`◑`, `▣`, `▃`) – medium stability.
- Right side (`◕`, `■`, `█`) – high stability.

No exact numeric mapping is defined here; the icons are meant as:

- small glyphs for legends,
- visual hints next to RDSI values in mockups or diagrams.

**Typical use**

- Legend elements in diagrams that display RDSI.
- Inline hints in docs, e.g. “RDSI: 0.91 `◕`”.

## 5. Directional Error (Δ)

**Icons**

- `Δ̃`
- `⇀Δ`
- `Δ⇁`
- `ΔΔΔ`

**Meaning**

> *Drift from an ideal paradox-balanced field.*

Directional error is not just a scalar; it can have **direction** and
**mode**:

- `Δ̃` – small, subtle deviation.
- `⇀Δ` – drift in one direction (e.g. toward SLO over fairness).
- `Δ⇁` – drift in the opposite direction.
- `ΔΔΔ` – oscillatory / unstable behaviour, the system bouncing between
  directions.

**Typical use**

- In field diagrams to show dominant drift direction.
- Next to stability analyses when describing *how* the system tries to
  escape a balanced paradox state.

---

## 6. Pulse Mini-Spiral

**Icons**

- `⟳`
- `↻`
- `⟲⟲`

**Meaning**

> *Mini Pulse spiral; dynamic field evolution.*

These icons represent:

- iterative decision cycles,
- repeated evaluation under changing conditions,
- the process nature of Pulse (not a one-shot judgement).

**Typical use**

- Next to sections that describe iterative evaluation or repeated
  releases.
- In diagrams that show “next pulse / next iteration”.

---

## 7. EP-go1 Icon

**Icons**

- `•⧖●`
- `•⟶●`
- `•~●`

**Meaning**

> *Two sources → one field.*

These icons represent:

- two distinct sources (e.g. two models, or two perspectives) that
  feed into one shared field,
- or two collaborating agents that co-create a Decision Field.

`•⧖●` can be read as *time / delay / synchronisation* between sources,  
`•⟶●` as a direct flow,  
`•~●` as a softer, field-like influence.

**Typical use**

- In lab docs for co-creation setups.
- As a small emblem for collaborations where multiple systems or
  modalities define one shared field.

---

## 8. E•Paradox Labs Icon

**Icons**

- `E•P`
- `⟦E•P⟧`

**Meaning**

> *The lab / workshop signature mark.*

This icon marks:

- artefacts, notes, or experiments that belong to the “E•Paradox Labs”
  workshop space,
- without implying that they are stable, production PULSE components.

`⟦E•P⟧` suggests *bracketed*, experimental context.

**Typical use**

- On internal / experimental docs.
- At the top of lab notebooks or design sketches.

---

## 9. Usage notes

- All icons in this document are **optional**:
  - they are a shared visual vocabulary,
  - not binding UI or branding requirements.
- Different fonts and platforms may render some Unicode glyphs
  differently (e.g. `⧖`, `⟲`), so it is recommended to:
  - test the icons in the target environment,
  - or fall back to simpler ASCII approximations where needed.
- New icons can be added in future versions (e.g. `PULSE_visual_map_v1`)
  as the Decision Field and its tooling evolve.

The purpose of **PULSE Visual Map v0** is to make the Decision Field
recognisable at a glance: even a few small glyphs (`[(0 1)_P]`,
`⇄`, `⦿〰〰〰`, `◔—◑—◕`) should be enough to signal that we are inside
the Pulse field-language, not a generic metrics dashboard.
